# simple_website_01
This was an incredibly simple website I built for fun, beginning to jog my memory of HTML/CSS fundamentals. The goal wasn't to challenge nor hone my Super Saiyan programming or design abilities; it wasn't to include industry-standard accessibility; and it wasn't intended to be pretty. It was a quick project as I reintroduce myself to simple concepts, insuring I don't forget the root of my knowledge as I move into remembering more complicated dev tools.
